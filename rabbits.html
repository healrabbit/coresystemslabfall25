   <center> <h4> <i>Overview </i></h4> </center>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  Rabbits are small, herbivorous mammals that belong to the family Leporidae, and they are widely recognized for their long ears, strong hind legs, and soft fur. Although often associated with domestic pets or the Easter holiday, rabbits have a fascinating biology and a deep ecological role in the wild. They can be found on every continent except Antarctica, living in habitats that range from meadows and forests to deserts and wetlands. Their adaptability and reproductive capacity have made them both beloved companions and, in some cases, agricultural pests. </p>

   <center> <h4><i> Anatomy</i> </h4> </center>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  One of the most striking features of rabbits is their physical design. Their long ears serve not only as a charming characteristic but also as an important survival tool. These ears are highly sensitive to sound, allowing rabbits to detect predators from a distance. Additionally, the large surface area of their ears helps regulate body temperature, especially in hotter climates. Their powerful hind legs are built for quick bursts of speed and agility, enabling them to evade danger by zigzagging across open terrain. This combination of acute hearing and rapid movement makes rabbits well adapted to living in environments full of predators. </p>

   <center> <h4><i> Diet </i></h4> </center>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Diet is another defining aspect of rabbit life. Rabbits are strict herbivores, consuming grasses, leaves, flowers, and bark. Their digestive system is uniquely adapted to process tough plant material. A particularly interesting trait is their practice of coprophagy: rabbits produce two types of droppings, and they will re-ingest one type to maximize nutrient absorption. This behavior ensures they extract as much nutrition as possible from fibrous food, allowing them to thrive on a relatively simple diet.</p>

   <center> <h4><i>Social Structure </i> </h4> </center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Social structure varies among rabbit species. The European rabbit, for example, is highly social and often lives in groups within complex burrow systems known as warrens. These warrens provide protection from predators and harsh weather, while also creating a communal environment for raising young. Other species, such as the cottontail rabbit, tend to be more solitary and rely on natural cover rather than burrows for safety. Regardless of their social tendencies, rabbits are known for their rapid reproduction. A single female, or doe, can produce several litters each year, each containing multiple offspring. This high reproductive rate is an evolutionary strategy to counter high predation rates in the wild.</p>

 <center> <h4><i> Cultural Presence </i></h4> </center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  Beyond their ecological significance, rabbits have long held a place in human culture. They are symbols of fertility, renewal, and luck in many traditions. In literature and folklore, rabbits are often portrayed as clever or whimsical creatures, from the trickster figures in Native American tales to Lewis Carroll’s White Rabbit in Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. Domesticated rabbits have also become popular pets, valued for their gentle nature and wide variety of breeds, each with distinctive appearances and personalities.</p>

    <center> <h4> <i>Ecological Role </i></h4> </center>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  In modern ecosystems, rabbits play a dual role. On one hand, they are crucial prey animals, supporting populations of foxes, birds of prey, and other carnivores. On the other, their grazing habits influence vegetation patterns and can sometimes lead to overgrazing if populations grow unchecked. In some regions, introduced rabbit populations have caused serious ecological challenges, particularly in places like Australia, where they were brought by European settlers.</p>
